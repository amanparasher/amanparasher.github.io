<!-- Hello! I'm Aman Parasher.

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a **B.Tech graduate** and a **Data Engineer Intern at Mactores**, where I build and manage real-world data pipelines. I am deeply focused on the **Databricks ecosystem** and am currently pursuing the Databricks Data Engineer Professional certification, having already cleared the Associate level.

My journey to this point was built on a foundation of intensive, hands-on learning during my B.Tech at SRMIST (2022-2025). This included a **3-month AI research internship in Taiwan** (specializing in Deep Learning and Computer Vision) and practical virtual internships with industry leaders like KPMG and TATA.

This hands-on engineering experience is complemented by my unique background in tech recruiting, giving me a rare perspective on how to build data solutions that deliver real business value. This portfolio is a showcase of that philosophy. Here you'll find end-to-end projects that solve real, recognizable business problems.
